          What we found from NY Warn Notices?

          By analyzing the data from python, there are three findings that I think are worthwhile to talk about, as they all convey some information of the coronavirus.
        </p>

        <div class="g-chart">
          <iframe title="NY WARN Notifications by Reasons " aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-LsDvA" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LsDvA/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"
            height="475"></iframe>
          <script type="text/javascript">
            ! function() {
              "use strict";
              window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
                if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                  for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                    var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                    t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                  }
              }))
            }();
          </script>
        </div>

        <p class="g-copy">
          By checking with the chart above, it shows numbers of warn notices about reasons states for filing. The chart closely refelcts why the unemployment rate during the coronavirus hit the bottom of the economy since the last Recession. It is
          obvious that filings of temporary plant layoff and temporary plant closing are the major filings reasons. Because of stay-home and close-unessential-businesses orders since March, the chart makes sense that temporary layoffs increased
          instanly in the past few months.
        </p>


        <div class="g-chart">
          <iframe title="NY WARN Notifications by Reasons of Dislocation" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-<iframe title=" NY WARN Notifications by Reasons of Dislocation" aria-label="Dot Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-yDTkz"

          <script type="text/javascript">
            ! function() {
              "use strict";
              window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
                if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                  for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                    var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                    t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                  }
              }))
            }();
          </script>
        </div>

        <p class="g-copy">
          The second chart I want to analyze is about reasons for dislocation of those warn notices. As there are too many different reason for dislocation, I only selected the reasons with more than 1 warn notice. The chart is very dramatic, as it
          illustrates how wide the influence of the coronavirus is. The top reason for dislocation is "Unforeseeable business circumstances prompted by COVID-19", which probably has the same explanation as the finding from the first chart.
        </p>

          <iframe title="NY WARN Notifications by Business Types" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-LsDvA" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LsDvA/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="307"></iframe>
          <script type="text/javascript">
            ! function() {
              "use strict";
              window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
                if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                  for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                    var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                    t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                  }
              }))
            }();
          </script>
        </div>

        <p class="g-copy">
          The last finding I want to talk about is the business types that filed most in the pandemic. From the chart above, services industry, reatil industy and hospitality industry are hit hardest by the coronvirus, the same reason as the first
          chart that stay-home and social-distancing orders limted them a lot. To be more specific, resturants, hotel and retail are the top three industries that filed most warn notices this year. The finding shows those industries need more help in
          such a hard time.
